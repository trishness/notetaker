# notetaker
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a note-taking application with the use of an express server. When a user enters the site, they should be able to click on "Get Started", at which point they will be taken to a page where they are able to add a title and text to a note, save a note and delete a note. By using a server, a user's note should also be saved after refreshing the page. This was the first assignment that was deployed on Heroku, giving any user the ability to access the page and the server. GET, POST, and DELETE were the main tasks to complete this assignment, meaning that functions needed to be built that would get api information, allow a user to post/delete information. There were many moving pieces to this assignment as well as careful, detail oriented steps.
